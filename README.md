   Predict bike-sharing pattern
   
2. Convolutional neural networks
   Applying transfer learning to build an app that classify a dog breeds by using human and dog data.
   
3. Recurrent neural networks
   Using Long-Short term momory (LSTM) to generate a new TV scripts
   
4. Generative Adversarial Networks
   Using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks to generate new faces from Hollywood celebrities.
   
5. Amazon SageMaker model deployment
   Deploy the model to amazon sagemaker.
